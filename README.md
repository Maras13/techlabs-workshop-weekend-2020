## Project Structure

The project follows a regular [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) skeleton with very few modifications.

Under the src folder, we have two main directories:

### `shared`:

Which contains, as the name suggests, shared behavior, including:

- `assets/`: Images, CSS files, and other static assets
- `components/`: Components reused across pages
- `layouts/`: Reusable Layouts
- `models/`: Shared interfaces, enums, type aliases, and other TypeScript stuff
- `utils/`: Helper functions reusable across the project

### `modules/`:

These are each isolated functionality. Examples are:

- `auth`, split into `sign-in` and `sign-up`;
- `home`
- `events`

Each module is organized in:

- `components/`: Components relevant to that page
- `hooks`: Selectors, data access and mutation, and other hooks
- `models/`: TypeScript relevant stuff

Directories look like this:

```sh
|-- shared/
|   |-- api/
|   |-- assets/
|   |-- components/
|   |-- core/
|   |-- layouts/
|   |-- models/
|   |-- utils/
|   |-- ...
|-- modules/
|	|-- auth/
|		|-- sign-in/

|		|-- hooks.ts
|		|-- models.ts
|		|-- index.ts
|		|-- ...
|   |-- ...
|   |-- api/

```
